getResource
============
getResource looks on the classpath to find files 
The classpath for a program executed in a jar file is inside the jar file: 
D:\Users\kluges1\workspace\pac-tool\jar\WinDefinition.jar!\gui\html\Abreviation.html 
<<<  Note the ! 
The path up to the ! represents the jar file. 
The path to the resource is added to the end of the classpath. 

Conclusion:
    A resource in a jar file is not a File, so you can't treat it as one.
	--> Use getResourceAsStream and use InputStreamReader instead of FileReader.
