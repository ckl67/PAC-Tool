Logging level has to be configured in file: /pac-tool/src/log4j2.xml

Configuring loggers
=====================
A LoggerConfig is configured using the logger element. 
The logger element must have a name attribute specified, will usually have a level attribute specified 
and may also have an additivity attribute specified. 
The level may be configured with one of TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, ALL or OFF. 
	The additivity attribute may be assigned a value of true or false. If the attribute is omitted 
	the default value of false will be used.

Every configuration must have a root logger. 

Configuring Appenders
=========================
An appender is configured either using the specific appender plugin's name or with an appender element and the type 
attibute containing the appender plugin's name. In addition each appender must have a name attribute specified with 
a value that is unique within the set of appenders. The name will be used by loggers to reference the appender 
as described in the previous section.

Configuring Appenders
=========================
Avoid
	e.printStackTrace();
Replace
	logger.error("Ops!", e);
